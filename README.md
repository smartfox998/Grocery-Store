### Goal and Value of the Application
This is an application that can be used by grocery store. Users can add or remove products based on their requirements. Users can use the filter area on the left to choose their preferred product type. They can also sort the products by price and rating.

### Usability Principles Considered

* The shopping cart is sticked on the right to make sure users could always see the updates.

* The filter and sort section is sticked on the left, it won't disappear when users scroll down or up to browse through products.

* There is a **All** choice for both two filters to make sure users could revert back to the original state without refreshing the page.

### Organization of Components

There are 6 components in total:

* TypeFilterSection: This is the component 

* AvailableFilterSection:
